# Deep learning of geological structures from seismic reflection data

![alt text](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/image.png)

Here we are sharing our code, tutorials and examples used to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning. You can find a few visual examples on our [poster](https://www.thilowrona.com/posters) and more technical details in our preprint (uploaded to EarthArXiv in October).

To get started, you don't need any special hardware, software, data or experience - just a bit of time.

## Tutorials

### [Tutorial-1](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-1/tutorial-1.ipynb)
- This tutorial shows how to map salt in a 2-D seismic image using a 2-D convolutional neural network for pixel-wise classification.

### [Tutorial-2](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-2/tutorial-2.ipynb)
- This tutorial describes how to speed up our mapping using U-Net type convolutional neural networks.

### [Tutorial-3](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-3/tutorial-3.ipynb)
- This tutorial will show how to map tectonic faults in a 3-D seismic volume.

### [Tutorial-4](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-4/tutorial-4.ipynb)
- This tutorial will explain how we can translate our whole workflow to 3-D.

### [Tutorial-5](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/tutorial-5/tutorial-5.ipynb)
- This tutorial will show how we can map stratigraphic horizons in a 3-D seismic volume.
